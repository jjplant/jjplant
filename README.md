- 👋 Hi, I’m Jay. Welcome to my little git repo. 
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, art and plants ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development, cloud development and looking at topics in Computer Vision and Deep Learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects that are visual and creative...
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at jjplant.place@gmail.com...

I will be adding more public projects as I port them over but for now, most things are private.
